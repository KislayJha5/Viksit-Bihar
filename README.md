# Viksit-Bihar
Bihar has transitioned from a period of stagnation to one of the fastest-growing states in India, largely driven by unprecedented investment in infrastructure and social sectors like Education and Healthcare. While the Service sector dominates its Gross State Value Added (GSVA) at 57.1% (2021-22)
1. Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)
⿡ Sector Overview
The FMCG sector in Bihar is fundamentally driven by its large, young population and improving rural consumption. As an agrarian state, food processing forms the core of its FMCG base. The sector is key to translating agricultural output into value-added products and formal employment, particularly in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.
2. Healthcare
⿡ Sector Overview
The healthcare sector is central to Bihar's social development and its economic vision, recognized as both a humanitarian imperative and an economic strategy. It has traditionally suffered from high demand-supply mismatch and low private insurance penetration.
3. Education
⿡ Sector Overview
Education is the top priority sector for the Government of Bihar, receiving the highest allocation among all state sectors (Budget of ₹40,450 crore in 2023–24). The sector's primary focus has been on universal access, equity, and, more recently, quality and workforce alignment.
4. IT & ITES
⿡ Sector Overview
The IT & ITES sector is critical for leveraging Bihar’s greatest asset: its abundant pool of skilled youth (BE/BTech, MCA, MBA graduates). Despite having a large pool of talent migrating out, the state has historically lagged in establishing an IT/ITES manufacturing and services base. The new policy is designed to reverse this trend.
5. Logistics & Supply Chain
⿡ Sector Overview
Logistics and Supply Chain are the foundational sectors for industrialisation in a landlocked state like Bihar, which acts as a bridge between Eastern and Northern India. The sector's growth is inextricably linked to infrastructure development (roads, railways, and waterways) and its success is a pre-requisite for the growth of FMCG and manufacturing.
